This file is a part of a web framework that I wrote following a guide in Go
The framework is used for my mouseyears application as the backend retrieving 
items from the database and returning it to the frontend.

This part is the middleware which goes in between the http router and the actual
function which handles the http request. These functions are repeated functions
that always should be called for every http request.
